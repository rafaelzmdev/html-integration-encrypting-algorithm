uses a second degree equation to generate a cipher that can be reverse-engineered with ease when disposed of the a, b and c coefficients.
essentially assigns an ASCII cipher for a text, then applies a second degree equation with the coefficients being chosen by the user (keys), then outputs the encrypted text. to decrypt, the user needs to provide the keys and the encrypted text. 
this is VERY easy to reverse-engineer without any other info than the encrypted text itself, but it's still fun to use! ;)
and you also need to have some algebra knowledge to reverse-engineer the code without the coefficients so.. this can have some use
